# Unity SVG Renderer
Sample source code for parsing and rendering SVG in Unity 4.5 or 4.6 (onwards not tested).

Included in the sample code is the SVGPolygon class, which supports the generation of polygon meshes.

Using SVG in Unity saves space on art assets, requiring only one set of images for all screen sizes and resolutions. Unlike with raster images, SVG images do not lose quality when scaled, as they are defined by their geometry rather than pixels.
