# Scripts
Load svg files from the Resources/SVG/ directory, and call the importSVG method in SVGtoMesh in order to generate the corresponding SVG objects inside Unity. Only <polygon> type SVG files are supported, and there are restrictions on the syntax that can be used with the sample code. See Resources/SVG/example.txt for syntax which will work with the sample code. 

The project uses the HexConverter and Traingulator classes from the Unify Wiki, which are included in the sample and can be found on the following links:
